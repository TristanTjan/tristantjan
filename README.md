### Hi there, I'm Tristan 👋

I live in the San Diego area at the moment and have always loved technology! 


I am currently working on building a Cyber Deck with a Raspberry Pi 4 and 3D printing a custom case! 💻

I am working on learning Python, C++, and maybe even C using Microsoft Visual Studio 👩‍💻

Always looking to learn! 🎓

Ask me anything :)
